Create an Amazing Power BI Dashboard | Real Estate Sales Dashboard

🎯 Problem Statement
Real estate investors, analysts, and brokers often struggle to understand which property types, price ranges, or features drive profitability.
Raw transaction data is scattered and difficult to interpret — making it hard to answer questions like:
Which bedroom type gives the best ROI?
Are waterfront homes really worth the premium?
How do price trends shift month-to-month?
This dashboard solves the problem by transforming raw property data into a clear, interactive visual story — revealing patterns, profitability, and key market drivers in seconds.

In this Power BI tutorial, you’ll learn how to build a professional Real Estate Dashboard from scratch using Power BI Desktop.
We’ll transform property data into actionable insights with clean visuals, KPIs, and interactive charts that highlight profitability and trends.

Dashboard Creation:
Create KPI cards for Total Sales, Average Price, ROI, and Profit
Design bar, scatter, line, and donut charts for key performance comparisons
Build a Decomposition Tree to analyze price drivers by bedroom, grade, and view
Implement DAX measures for Profit, Cost, and ROI
Use themes and layouts to match a modern, investor-grade visual style
Segment properties by price range and location (e.g., waterfront)
Analyze seasonal price fluctuations using time-based visuals

🛏 Average Price by Bedrooms
Price increases with bedroom count up to around 7–8 bedrooms, then slightly declines.
Indicates diminishing returns on very large homes.

📉 Price vs Size

Waterfront properties (orange dots) command premium prices even at smaller sizes.

💧 Waterfront Analysis
Only 0.75 % of properties are waterfront.
Yet they represent a significant share of high-value transactions, showing strong luxury demand.

📅 Average Price by Month
Volatility observed across months; dip around Jan 2015 followed by strong rebound by Apr 2015.
Suggests cyclical buyer behavior or seasonality.

💰 Price Range Distribution
$200K–$600K dominates with ~14K+ units sold.
Luxury segment ($1M+) smaller in count but large in total value contribution.

🪜 Decomposition Tree
Bedrooms, grade, and view are the strongest price drivers.
Higher grade and better view significantly boost average prices.
Grade 13 + View 3 or 4 deliver the highest valuations (above $6.8 M).

💡 Summary Insights
Market shows strong mid-tier activity and healthy luxury margins.
Waterfront and high-grade homes deliver outsized ROI.
Larger homes beyond 8 bedrooms may not scale profitably.
Stable ROI (25%) implies an efficient, well-priced market.
Seasonal trends could guide optimal listing and launch periods.
